Hello ! Interestingly, Programming is my first love. Following my passion I decided to persue B.Tech from [Bharati Vidyapeeth's College of Engineering](https://bvcoend.ac.in/).

Kickstarting my first year at College with an Internship at [Shuniyavigyan]() and
Contributing my bit in [GirlsScript Summer of Code](https://gssoc.girlscript.tech/).

Technologies that I'm familiar with !
